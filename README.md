## Inspiration
About 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Every 2 minutes, one case of breast cancer is diagnosed in a woman in the U.S. The patient can be your mom, your grandmothers or aunts. This affects not only the breast cancer patients but it also affects you. Because of that, we want to develop "My hero".

Seeing your loved ones fighting breast cancer is painful and difficult. It is hard to imagine how painful your loved ones have to go through to fight the disease. You really want to help but you don't know how to support your mother, your grandmother, or your aunt who have breast cancer. 

My Hero is an App that can empower you who want to support your loved ones to fight breast cancer. The app has features that allow you to do works for your loved ones who have breast cancer. The app educates you about breast cancer and gives you resources to support your breast cancer hero.

## What it does
Our app has the following functions:
- Track your breast cancer hero's mood and your mood
- Suggest activities you can do with your breast cancer hero to make them feel better
- Build your own custom to do list
- Let you send encouraging messages to your hero 
- Present more resources for you to support your hero
- Tips about how to communicate with your hero and what to avoid saying to your hero

## How we built it
- We built our website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- We built and designed our app in Figma 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to bring everything into a project and showed our vision of what our app and our site looks likes. We planned to include VisualDx in our development but had to scrap the idea because we couldn't sign up for the service. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build a website for "My hero" and we were able to develop and design our app to convey our thought.

## What we learned
We learnt to design in Figma and develop everything in the span of 2 days. We learnt to design our page to be user friendly. 

## What's next for My Hero
We would like to include more functions that are user friendly. We want to gametify the points and encourage users to support their heroes more.
